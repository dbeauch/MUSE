# PythonToMCNP
This is a project designed to produce Monte Carlo N-Particle transport code (MCNP) using Python. This has been made for the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR). To use, see the template file "input_file_generator.py" and construct card objects in the "all_cards[]" array. Card objects are documented and defined in "mcnp_cards.py".
